Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction
This project is part of the DataTalks.Club ML Zoomcamp midterm. It is a classification model that predicts whether a person is at risk of a heart attack based on clinical parameters. The model is deployed using Streamlit.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
Heart disease is a major cause of death worldwide. Predicting the chances of a heart attack early can help save lives. This project uses machine learning to make that prediction using patient data.

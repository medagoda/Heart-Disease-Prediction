# ❤️ Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction

A machine learning classification project to predict whether a person is at risk of a heart attack based on clinical data.
 

## 📊 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction can save lives.  
This project uses clinical parameters and machine learning to detect heart attack risk.

- ✅ Classification Problem
- 🧪 Trained on real-world medical data
- 📈 Best model: **XGBoost Classifier**
- 🌐 Deployed live on **Streamlit**
